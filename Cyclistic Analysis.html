                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone course, where the goal is to perform real-world data analysis tasks as a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share program in Chicago. The analysis will follow the standard data analysis process to provide insights that can help the Cyclistic marketing team devise strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.</p>

                    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
                    <p>Analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in terms of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bike type preferences</li>
                        <li>Temporal patterns of usage (monthly, weekly, daily)</li>
                        <li>Ride duration</li>
                        <li>Start and end station locations</li>
                    </ul>    
                    <p>Identify reasons why casual riders might be motivated to purchase annual Cyclistic memberships based on usage patterns.</p>
                    <p>Provide recommendations on how Cyclistic can leverage digital media to influence casual riders to become annual members.</p>

                    <h2>Data Collection and Sources</h2>
                    <p>This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone course, where the goal is to perform real-world data analysis tasks as a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share program in Chicago. The analysis will follow the standard data analysis process to provide insights that can help the Cyclistic marketing team devise strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.The dataset covers January 2022 to December 2022, containing a total of 5.6 million rows of trip data. Due to its large size, the data will be processed and analyzed using BigQuery. This historical trip data provides the necessary information to understand the different usage patterns between Cyclistic's annual members and casual riders, which is the focus of the analysis.</p>
